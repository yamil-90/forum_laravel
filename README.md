## About the Forum

this is a test Forum done initially in Laravel 7 but later updated to Laravel 8 to avoid breaking changes.

Things you can do at the Forum:
- Create your own user
- Create, edit and delete your posts
- View all posts or filter them by category
- Comment on posts and reply those comments

If you are an admin you can also:
- Administer Users, view all and delete them if they break the rules or post memes in general
- Administer Post, the same way as with users
- Create or delete new Categories
